        ***WHEN CLICKED REVEALS SEASONED***(A salt, pepper, herbs, and spices developer) who's worked extensively with technologies such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and React for over 3 years. 
          My focus is on creating clean, efficient, and scalable backend solutions, and sometimes acting like a goofball ***CLICKED REVEALS GOOFSPHERE*** 
          Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and continuously improve my skill set.

        I've always LOVED tech! Untill eventually stuff breaksdown and you start reflecting on your life decisions :)
        I don't come from a traditional CS background but that seems to be the norm these days! I was born in Ukraine but I grew up in the US and Iran.
        I started out with a degree in English Literature back in college, and wanted to become a teacher. And I did!
        But I also wanted more. Coding and SWE in any capacity has an unbelievable rush and feeling like no other.
        I had somewhat of a soft transition into tech when I took Harvard's CS50 ***LINK*** back in 2020. And ever since then, I just made things!
        I strongly advocate for persistence, meaning that if you spend enough time doing anything, you're gonna become good at that said thing IF YOU TRY TO LEARN FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY GOOD AT IT!
        The first real project I ever worked on was ***LINK to uni's website*** where I, along with a couple of like minded indviduals who hated sleep, worked on improving the most horrible website ever.
        It was challenging, tough, and I had to learn more than I did in my entire life long before tools like AI were a thing!
        But this taught me that the field of SWE is all about the same cycle of learning something new to solve a problem then doing it over and over again untill you become comfortable with being uncomfortable.
        Since then, I put myself out there and have worked as a contractor/freelancer for clients of all sizes while continuing to teach English for ***link to website***
        I worked on many projects. Some more exciting, some less. Building/improving web applications in different sectors like: medicine, e-commerce, and even entertainment!
        Life was good but definitely not reflecticve of "work-life balance", and there was also something missing. 
        In mid 2023 however, I recieved a surprise call from one of my old friends from college who's in the states.
        He had a brilliant idea for a startup and wanted me to join! I was literally shaking because I knew what it meant: I had to go all in.
        Gone were the days of teaching English to people, and in were the days of rapid development with prestine precision, and the occasional why isn't this working.
        Over the past year, I've gained enough experience working closely with our backend team to deliver something I can say I'm proud of!
        It's now August 2024 as of writing this, and I have a feeling that it's just the begining for me.
